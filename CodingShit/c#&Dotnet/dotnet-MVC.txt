differnce between actionResult and IactionResult
IActionResult is an interface, we can create a custom response as a return, when you use ActionResult you can return only predefined ones for returning a View or 
a resource. With IActionResult we can return a response, or error as well. On the other hand, ActionResult is an abstract class, and you would need to make a custom 
class that inherits.


webconfig
    setting xml file . it can contains Database connections, Caching settings, Session States, Error Handling, Security.
    There is also Machine config file . The Machine.config file contains settings for all sites running on the machine provided another .config further up the chain does 
    not override any of these settings. Although Machine.config provides a global configuration option, you can use .config files inside individual website directories to
    provide more granular control.

ROUTING - Routing is the first step in the ASP.NET MVC pipeline. Routing is a pattern-matching system that matches the incoming request to the registered URL patterns residing in the Route Table. 
    When an ASP.NET MVC application starts, it registers patterns to the RouteTable to tell the routing engine to give a response to the requests that match these patterns.
    An application has only one RouteTable and it resides in the Application_Start event of Global.asax of the application.
    (we can Constrint,optiona and default parameter in routing) 
 types of routing 

    convential routing
    This is the default routing mechanism in ASP.NET MVC. It uses a predefined URL pattern to map incoming requests to controller actions. The typical pattern is:
    {controller}/{action}/{id}
    controller: The name of the controller (e.g., HomeController).
    action: The action method within the controller (e.g., Index).
    id: An optional parameter, often used to identify a specific resource.

    attribute routing
    It creates routes based on attributes placed on the controller or action level. Attribute routing provides us more control over the URL generation patterns which helps us in SEO.
    it provide routing token such as [area], [controller], and [action]. These tokens get replaced by their values in the route table.
    The most common root cause of slow routing performance is usually a badly behaving custom middleware.

Authorize attribute 
check for autherntication and role  which is stored in cookie after while login . managed automatically and configured in the webconfig

        <forms loginUrl="~/Account/Login" timeout="2880" />
    </authentication>

what is difference between ViewResult and actionResult 
    ActionResult is the base class for all action result types in ASP.NET MVC. It represents the result of an action method.
    Flexibility: It allows a method to return various types of results, such as:
        ViewResult: Renders a view.
        JsonResult: Returns JSON data.
        RedirectResult: Redirects to another action or URL.
        ContentResult: Returns plain text or HTML.
        FileResult: Sends binary files to the response.
        ViewResult
ViewResult it is Derived Class: ViewResult is a specific type of ActionResult that is used to render a view.

 difference between 
 ViewResult and Redirect result

 filters and action filters

Filters allow  code to to run before or after code there are some built in filters for Authorization and customs filters are generally
made for configuration , Error Handling and loggin 
Filter can be applied globally or on specific controller and method level with attribute filter.

Ex IActionFilter interface with the methods OnActionExecuting and OnActionExecuted  
To make attribute filter we have to inherit Attribute class and also we can make parameterized constructor in filter
We can change the order of the filter by IOrderFilter interface

Purpose: Filters are specific to MVC/Web API applications and provide a way to inject logic at various stages of the request-processing pipeline (e.g., before or after action methods run).
Execution Order: Filters are executed in a more fine-grained manner compared to middleware. They run before and/or after action methods in MVC/Web API controllers.
Scope: Filters can be scoped to specific actions or controllers, making them more granular. There are several types of filters, such as Authorization Filters, Action Filters, Result Filters, and Exception Filters.
Usage: Filters are used for actions like validation, authorization checks, logging, exception handling, and modifying the result returned by actions.


MiddleWare
MiddleWare is integrated in app pipeline to handel the request and responses it is.
In core the middleware is manage in the configure method there are three way we can configure the middleware ,  app.Run , app.map , app.Use
app.Run run delegate receive the context parameter it doesn't know anything about next middleware and it will terminate the context
app.Use take the context and next parameter , any thing we write after next() is run after next() is executed after the next middleware is parameter is called
app.map is the convention that is use to branching the middleware will not run anyting normal middleware after that
also we can use app.MapWhen which is predicate ovrer context 

in dotnet core the configure method has default middleware  like app.UserHttpsRedirection , app.UseRouting, app.UseAuthorization

DotnetCore -  To server the staic file we have to use app.UseStaticFiles() middlleware .\,
To server the default file we have to use the app.UseDefaultFile()


IMiddleware Interface is use to make the MiddleWare Class and it is used as app.useMiddleware . We can also use dependency injection and 
constructor in middlleware

Difference between MiddleWare and Filters

Diffrence Between ViewBag, ViewData And TempData In MVC.
    ViewBag - This will pass the data as a property of the object. And we have no need to typecast to read the data or for null checking. Its scope is permitted to the
        current request, and  become null while redirecting.
    ViewData - Data is passed in the form of a key-value pair. Typecasting is required to read the data in View if the data is complex, and we need to ensure a null check 
        to avoid null exceptions. scope it is restricted to the current request, its value will become null while redirecting.
    TempData - TempData is a dictionary object to passes the data from one action to another action in the same Controller or different Controllers. Usually, stored in a 
        session object. Tempdata is also required to typecast and for null checking before reading data from it. TempData scope is limited to the next request [if we want 
        TempData to be available even further, we should use Keep and Peek.]

Startup class in core
Startup class in core limits the type of dependincy injection it only allow Iconfiguration, IHostEnviorment and IwebhostEnviorment etc  using other cause 
runtime error.

ModelBinding in core

Model binding takes the data from various souurce like form ,http body , parameters and querystrings etc. 
we can pass dictionary,json,xml or our custom format in query parameter to map with our model.
core comes with defalut json input formator.

we can restric the datatype by consumes attribute[]

validation in core

In core we can use the built in Model atrribute validators or can make custom validators. attribute validators blongs to system.componentModel.DataAnnotations Class
we can handle validation in controller and send error to modleState like ModelState.AddModelError(nameof(id),"id Filed is Required")
There is setting in core that  check the nullable state for the datatype  [#nullable enable]  in controller page or in csproj property
we can suppress this behaviour adding options.suppressimplicitrequiredattributefornonnullablereferencetypes in service.AddController option. 


Apart form ModelstateValidation error there can be model bining error eg.sending sting in bool type.
Model state represent error from 2 subsyatem ModelValidation and ModelBinding 
 [ApiController] automatically manage the request handling 

 We can also use the interface IValidatableObject to

Dependency Injection
Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern and a technique used to achieve Inversion of Control (IoC). It is used to inject the dependencies (services or objects) that a class needs rather than having the class create those dependencies itself. This promotes loose coupling between components and helps in making the code more testable, maintainable, and flexible.
In simpler terms, DI allows you to provide an object that a class depends on (its dependency) from the outside, rather than allowing the class to create it. This allows the class to focus only on its core logic, and the responsibility of creating dependencies is shifted to an external entity, like a DI container.
Types of Dependency Injection
There are three primary types of DI in .NET:
    Constructor Injection
    Setter (or Property) Injection
    Interface Injection
    function Injection.
